# Train-Scheduler-Repo

In this app a train schedule is shown displaying a list of trains along with their destination, arrival frequency (in minutes), the next arrival and minutes left until next arrival. New trains can be added using the "ADD TRAIN" form and information will be displayed automatically in train list. The arrival times and minutes remaining information stays up-to-date with the current time for the various trains including any newly added trains.
